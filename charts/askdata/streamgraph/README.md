# Stream Graph

A stream graph, is a type of **Stacked area** graph which is displaced around a central axis, resulting in a flowing, organic shape.

Stream graphs display the changes in data over time of different categories through the use of flowing, organic shapes that somewhat resemble a river-like stream. This makes Stream Graphs aesthetically pleasing and more engaging to look at.

In a Stream graph, the size of each individual stream shape is proportional to the values in each category. The axis that a Stream Graph flows parallel to, is used for the time scale.

Contrary to a stacked area, there is no corner: edges are rounded what gives this nice impression of flow. Moreover, areas are usually displaced around a central axis, resulting in a flowing and organic shape.

Stream graphs are ideal for displaying high-volume datasets, in-order to discover trends and patterns over time across a wide range of categories.

## What For

Streamchart are good to study the relative proportions of the whole. However they are bad to study the evolution of each individual group: it is very hard to substract the height of other groups at each time point. For a more accurate but less attractive figure, consider a line chart or area chart using small multiple.

Stream chart gets really useful when displayed in an interactive mode: highlighting a group gives you directly an insight of its evolution.

## Variations

### Over the 0 Axis
Even if areas are usually displaced around a central axis, it is possible to display them as for most of the chart type: over the 0 axis.

### Percent Streamchart
It also possible to create a percent streamchart where the proportion of each group is displayed instead of its absolute value. Here, the total number of baby names is not available anymore. However, the most popular names at each period gets more obvious.

## Caveats

Streamgraph work well when there is a clear pattern in the data. If the proportion of each group remain more or less the same all along the time frame, the figure wonâ€™t be very insightfull since small variations will be hard to read.
